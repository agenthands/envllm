# EnvLM

EnvLM is a Go-native execution environment and constrained DSL for Recursive Language Model (RLM) apps.

## Why
Recursive Language Models require a safe, deterministic, and LLM-friendly environment to operate.

## Design Principles
- **One canonical form per operation**
- **Mandatory named outputs (INTO)**
- **Explicit cell blocks**
- **Safe by default (budgeted recursion)**

## Quick Start
TODO: Add installation and basic usage.

## Repository Layout
- `assets/`: Operation definitions
- `cmd/`: CLI binaries
- `docs/`: Specifications and guides
- `internal/`: Core runtime and logic
- `schemas/`: JSON schemas for validation
